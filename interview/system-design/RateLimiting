RateLimiting

Background:
Imagine weâ€™ve a service which is receiving a huge number of requests, but it can only serve a limited number of requests per second. 
Rate Limiting is process of limting the requests being processed under a limit based on some criteria.
1.Number of transactions during a certain duration.
2.Number of failed transactions by an user.
3.Requests which can be made by a particular ip address.

Why Do we need it?
1.Mitigate DDOS
2.Stop Security breach by brute force method.

Above reasons are enough to bring the service down so hence to increase the availability.
